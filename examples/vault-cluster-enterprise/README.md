# Vault Cluster Enterprise Example

This example deploys a privately accessible [Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault) Enterprise cluster
in [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) fronted by a Regional External Load Balancer using the [vault-cluster](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/modules/vault-cluster) and [vault-lb-fr](
/modules/vault-lb-fr) modules. In this example we also install a Vault Enterprise license key and enable the Auto Unseal feature.

For an example of a private Vault cluster that is accessible only from inside the Google
Cloud VPC, see [vault-cluster-private](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/examples/vault-cluster-private).
**Deploying Vault in a publicly accessible way should be avoided if possible due to the increased security exposure.
However, it may be unavoidable, if, for example, Vault is your system of record for identity.**.

The Vault cluster uses [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) as a storage backend, so this example also deploys a separate
Consul server cluster using the [consul-cluster module](
https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/modules/consul-cluster) from the Consul GCP Module.

You will need to create a [Google Image](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images) that has the Vault and Consul
Enterprise versions installed, which you can do using the [vault-consul-image example](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/examples/vault-consul-image)). Keep in mind,
to be able to run the Enterprise version of Vault or Consul, you must specify the Vault & Consul Enterprise download
URLs using the `VAULT_DOWNLOAD_URL` and `CONSUL_DOWNLOAD_URL` environment variables respectively.

Note that a Google Load Balancer requires a Health Check to confirm that the Vault nodes are healthy, but at this time,
Google Cloud only supports [associating HTTP Health Checks with a Target Pool](
https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google/issues/18), not HTTPS Health Checks. The recommended
workaround is to run a separate proxy server that listens over HTTP and forwards requests to the HTTPS Vault endpoint.
We accomplish this by using the [run-nginx](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/modules/run-nginx)
module to run the web server.

For more info on how the Vault cluster works, check out the [vault-cluster](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/modules/vault-cluster) documentation.

**Note:** This example will automatically create a Google Cloud KMS key. You can disable this behaviour by setting the `var.create_kms_crypto_key` variable to false. Crypto Keys cannot be deleted from Google Cloud Platform, however their versions can. Terraform will by default, erase all
Crypto Key versions when destroying the resource making any data encrypted by the key unrecoverable. For this reason we recommend reusing an
existing Cloud KMS key in production.

## Quick start

To deploy a Vault Cluster:

1. `git clone` this repo to your computer.
1. Build a Vault and Consul Enterprise Google Image. See the [vault-consul-image example](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/examples/vault-consul-image) documentation
   for instructions. Make sure to note down the ID or family name of the Google Image.
1. Create a [Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/kms/) key on your Google Cloud console. Make sure that the Cloud KMS
API is enabled, then create your key on the page `Cryptographic Keys`, which you will find under `Security`.
1. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
1. Make sure your local environment is authenticated to Google Cloud.
1. Open `variables.tf` and fill in any variables that don't have a default, including putting your Google Image ID into
   the `vault_source_image` and `consul_server_source_image` variables. Alternatively, initialize the variables by creating
   a `terraform.tfvars` file.
1. Run `terraform init`.
1. Run `terraform plan`.
1. If the plan looks good, run `terraform apply`.
1. To enable other Compute Instances in the same GCP Project to access the Vault Cluster, edit the `main.tf` file to
   modify the `allowed_inbound_tags_api` variables. To allow arbitary IP addresses to access the Vault cluster from
   within the VPC, modify the `allowed_inbound_cidr_blocks_api` variable.

[How do you use the Vault cluster?](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/modules/vault-cluster#how-do-you-use-the-vault-cluster) docs.

## SShing to the cluster?

## Applying your Vault Enterprise license
* Follow the steps in [Quick Start](#quick-start) to launch your Vault cluster.
* Ssh to one of the instances
* Set an environment variable `VAULT_ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_KEY` with your license key.
* Run `apply-license.sh`.
